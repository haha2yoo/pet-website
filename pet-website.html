  <h3><em>A haiku for Yuki</em></h3>
    <li>A fluffy monster</li>
    <li>Cuddles only on her terms</li>
    <li>Meows on diets</li>

  <p>Due to various reasons, Yuki was given away to 3 good friends of ours that moved and currently live in N. Carolina.</p>
  <p>She is well-loved with new loyalties to her 3 new moms that adore their new fluffy addition to the household.</p>
